              Spark is a list-managing Discord bot written in JavaScript. It utilizes the DiscordJS library 
              alongside NodeJS. It was created to manage a growing Discord community where a group watched 
              TV shows and played games, but wanted to keep track of what to watch or do next.

              With a series of 
              commands, Spark can add a TV show to a list, an event to a list, and change the status of a show 
              These lists are viewable in dedicated channels, so they are easily accessible. 
              Spark can also take a random show from one list or a random event from another in the case 
              that the group can't decide what to do. The bot can also flip a coin, produce a random
              number, and send links to the chat as a shorthand.
