        <h1>Spark - Discord Bot</h1>

        <img src="images/spark.png">

        <p>
            Spark is a list-managing Discord bot written in JavaScript. It utilizes the DiscordJS library <br/>
            alongside NodeJS. It was created to manage a growing Discord community where a group watched <br/>
            TV shows and played games, but wanted to keep track of what to watch or do next. With a series of <br/>
            commands, Spark can add a TV show to a list, an event to a list, and change the status of a show <br/>
            These lists are viewable in dedicated channels, so they are easily accessible. <br/>
            Spark can also take a random show from one list or a random event from another in the case <br/>
            that the group can't decide what to do. The bot can also flip a coin, produce a random <br/>
            number, and send links to the chat as a shorthand.
